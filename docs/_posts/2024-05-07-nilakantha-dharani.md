![avalokitesvara]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/avalokitesvara_250x363.png){: .align-left} The Nīlakaṇṭha Dhāraṇī, also known as the Mahākaruṇā(-citta) Dhāraṇī, 
Mahākaruṇika Dhāraṇī or Great Compassion Dhāraṇī/Mantra. 
The vulgate version is one of the three basic sutras of the Zen school of 
Buddhism in China, Korea and Japan. It is the shortest version and is the only 
one recited in the monasteries of China, Japan and Korea. The words are divided 
and numbered. The division of the words，consonants conjunction and vowels 
lengthening are not accurate. It was transcribed, in ancient times itself, 
from a sloppy recitation or from a defective manuscript which was not properly 
intelligible. （left image: Thousand-armed Avalokiteśvara, Bujo-ji monastery 
（峰定寺）, Kyoto, Japan. Wood decorated with cut gold-leaf designs, 31.5 cm high, 
Heian （平安） period, 12th century.)

Lokesh Chandra (1988) reconstructed mantra from the vulgate versions extant: 
Bh. Bhagavaddharma 伽梵達摩 (T1060)
Am. Amoghavajra 不空金剛 (T1113B) and Amoghavajra (T1111)
Ji. Jiun Sonja'text in Siddham 慈云尊者
Ko. Korean Tripiṭaka text 
A bilingual text from China (Tibten and Chinese). 

Mantras in ancient times were generally transcribed for their sound rather 
than translated for their meaning. Individual syllables or words often have 
significant historical anecdotes or multiple meanings, which cannot be fully 
covered by a few Chinese characters or English words.

In this article, both Sanskrit text and the English/Chinese translation 
of the (shorter) Great Compassion Mantra are presented for the purpose of 
reference only and should not be overly scrutinized.  There are many books and 
or articles explaining the content of the Great  Compassion Mantra, so merely 
looking at the literal meaning of the provided mantra translations is insufficient. 
This article does not represent the opinions of the translator, editor, or website, 
and is for reference only.

## Detailed Explanation

| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|<b><font size = "6">नमो रत्नत्रयाय</font></b>|namo ratna-trayāya|皈依三宝。|

**नमस्**, ind. a bow, salutation, obeisance, adoration; (this word is, by itself, 
invariably used with dat. The word has the sense of a noun, but is treated as 
an indeclinable.) By consonant sandhi rule 2.5, **स्**  changes to **ः**, next, **अः**, 
preceding soft consonant, becomes **ओ**, by visarga sandhi II.1 (semivowels are 
soft consonants derived from vowels) . 

**रत्न**,  n. a gift, present,goods, wealth,riches; a jewel, gem, treasure, precious
stone (the nine jewels are pearl, ruby, topaz, diamond, emerald, lapis lazuli 
(青金石), coral, sapphire, Gomeda (Hessonite Garnet 黑松石石榴石); hence ratna 
is a name for the number 9). 

**त्ररया**, mfn. Triple, threefold, consisting of 3, of 3 kinds, etc.; dat. case ending:  
**त्ररया + आय = रत्नत्रयाय**. 

|<b><font size = "6">नम आर्यावलोकितेश्वराय बोधिसत्त्वाय</font></b>|nama āryĀvalokiteśvarāya bodhisattvāya|皈依神圣的观自在菩提萨埵，|

**नमः** drops **ः** followed by vowels other than **अ**, by visarga sandhi II.3.

**आर्या**, m. a respectable or honourable or faithful man, an inhabitant of Āryāvarta; 
one who is faithful to the religion of his country; name of the race which 
immigrated from Central Asia into Āryāvarta; a man highly esteemed, a respectable, 
honourable man. 

**अव**, ind. (the initial **अ** is sometimes dropped) (As a preposition) Away, off, 
away from, down. 

**लोक्**, 1Ā. to see, view, perceive; **लोकित**, mfn. seen, beheld, viewed (past 
participle form of the root verb **लोक्**). 

**ईश्वर**, mfn. able to do, capable of, liable, exposed to etc.; master, lord, prince, 
king, mistress, queen etc.; God; the Supreme Being; the supreme soul (ātman);

**लोकित + ईश्वर = लोकितेश्वराय** by vowel sandhi rule, guṇa of **ई** is **ए**;  **ईश्वर + आय = ईश्वराय** is the 
dat. case ending, to/for. 

**बोधि**, m.f. (with Buddhists or Jainas) perfect knowledge or wisdom (by which a 
man becomes a Buddha or Jina), the illuminated or enlightened intellect (of a 
Buddhist or Jina). 

**सत्त्व**, n. being, existence, entity, reality; true essence, nature, disposition of 
mind; spiritual essence, spirit, mind; vital breath, life, consciousness, 
strength of character, strength, firmness, energy, resolution, courage, 
self-command, good sense, wisdom, magnanimity; m. n. a living or sentient being, 
creature, animal. **सत्त्व+ आय = सत्त्वाय** is the dat. case ending, to/for.

|<b><font size = "6">महासत्त्वाय महाकारुणिकाय</font></b>|mahāsattvāya mahākāruṇikāya|（皈依）大有情，（皈依）大悲心者。|

**कारुणिक**, mfn. (from **कारुण**,  mournful, miserable, lamenting) Compassionate, kind, 
tender. Both **सत्त्व** and **कारुणिक** are in the form of the dat. case endings, to/for.

|<b><font size = "6">ॐ सर्वभयेषु त्राणकराय</font></b>|oṃ sarva-bhayeṣu trāṇa-karāya|唵，（皈依）于一切恐怖中施守护者，|

Bh., Am. *tana* instead of *trāṇa-karāya*. Ji. and Ko. have the correct reading. 
Vajrabodhi (T 1061) has *sarva-bhayebhyo trāṇa-karāya*.

**सर्व**, sárva, mf(ā)n. whole, entire, all, every; of all sorts, manifold, various, 
different; (with another adjective or in comp.; cf. below) altogether, wholly, 
completely, in all parts, everywhere;

**भय** n. fear, alarm dread apprehension; fear of (abl. gen. or comp.); sg. and 
pl. terror, dismay, danger, peril, distress ; danger from (abl. or comp.).

|<b><font size = "6">तस्य नमस्कृत्वा</font></b>|tasya namaskṛtvā|归依彼尊，|

Ko. *tasmai*.

case (to/for) in Korean version. 

**कृ**, 5U. to hurt, injure, kill; 8U. to do, make, perform, accomplish, cause,

place, put, lay, bring, lead, take hold of (acc. or loc. or instr.). ind. p. 
**कृत्वा** (kṛtvā́) having done, the gerund form, i.e., noun derived from verb participle. 

**नमस्**,  n. bow, obeisance, reverential salutation, adoration (by gesture or word; 
often with dat. e.g. rāmāya namaḥ, salutation or glory to Rāma, often ind. 
[g. svar-ādi]; namas-√kṛ, to utter a salutation, do homage; ind.p. °mas-kṛ́tya 
[AV. TS. &c.] or °mas-kṛtvā [MBh. BhP.]; námas-kṛta, worshipped, adored) RV. 
&c. &c.; **नमःकृत्वा**, namaḥkṛtvā, in Korean version. 

|<b><font size = "6">इमं आर्यावलोकितेश्वरस्तवनं नीलकण्ठनाम</font></b>|imaṃ-āryĀvalokiteśvara-stavanaṃ Nīlakaṇṭha-nāma|此圣观自在赞叹青颈名。|

The Chinese character for *maṃ* is pronounced môung 蒙 (Couvreur 790c). *Imaṃ* 
stands for Classical Sanskrit *idam*.

The portion *-stavanaṁ Nilakaṇṭha-nāma*, is garbled in all the texts. Bh. seems 
to understand *-eśvaram tava namo Narakindi*. Am. follows him. Ji. reads 
*aryaarakiteśvariṃ dhava namo nilakaṇṭa nama*. Ko.: *āryāvalokiteśvara tava 
Nilakaṇṭha namaḥ* (=*āryāvalokiteśvara-stavaṃ Nilakaṇṭha-nāma*). Chin. *tavanamo* 
(Siddham *dhavanamo*) = *stavanaṁ* has been misinterpreted as *tava namaḥ* 
'salutation to you'. 

**इदम्**, idám, (a kind of neut. of the pronom.) this, this here, referring to something 
near the speaker; known, present; idam often refers to something immediately 
following, whereas etad points to what precedes (e.g. śrutvaîtad idam ūcuḥ, 
having heard that they said this). idam occurs connected with yad, tad, etad, 
kim, and a personal pronoun, partly to point out anything more distinctly and 
emphatically, partly pleonastically. **इमं** is the nasalized singular accusative 
case, while it is not nasalized in the Korean version **इमम**. 

**स्तु**, stu, 2P. 2Ā. (p. [mostly with pass. sense] stuvāná, stávāna or stavāná, 
stávamāna), to praise, laud, eulogize, extol, celebrate in song or hymns ; 

**स्तव**, stava, m. praise, eulogy, song of praise, hymn, panegyric. **स्तवन**, stavana, 
n. praising, praise; pl. songs of praise. **स्तवनं**, stavanaṃ, is the singular 
accusative case with nasalized ending.

**नीलकण्ठ**, mfn. blue-necked; N. of Śiva (as having a black throat from swallowing 
the poison produced at the churning of the ocean) **नील**, adj. blue; **कण्ठ**, m. the 
throat, the neck; the voice; sound, especially guttural sound; the neck 
(of a pitcher or jar), the narrowest part (e.g. of the womb; of a hole in which 
sacrificial fire is deposited; of a stalk &c.). 

**नाम**, ind. (acc. of nā́man) by name i.e. named, called.

|<b><font size = "6"> हृदयंवर्तयिष्यमि</font></b>| hṛdayaṃ-vartayiṣyami|（我）将诵心（咒），|

Am. (Siddham) *herima* = *hṛ[daya]ṃ*. Chin. *vartaṣāmi*, Siddham *vadhaṣami* = 
*vartayiṣyāmi* 'I will tell'. Compare *vārtā* 'talk' (in Hindi).

**हृदय**,  n. the heart (or region of the heart as the seat of feelings and sensations; 
hṛdaye-√kṛ, “to take to heart”), soul, mind (as the seat of mental operations; 
capala-hṛdaya, “fickle-minded”); the heart or interior of the body; the heart 
or centre or core or essence or best or dearest or most secret part of anything; 
true or divine knowledge; **हृदयम्** is the singular accusative case ending, of which 
the ending **म्** becomes **हृदयं** Anusvāra (ṁ), if followed by a beginning consonant. 

**वृत्**, vṛt, I. 4A. To choose, like; To distribute, divide. II. 10U. To shine.
III. 1A. To be, exist, abide, remain, subsist, stay; To be in any particular 
condition or circumstances; To happen, take place, occur, come to pass; 
To move on, proceed in regular course; To be maintained or supported by, live on, 
subsist by (fig. also); To turn, roll on, revolve; To occupy or engage oneself, 
be occupied or engaged in, set about (with loc); To act, behave, conduct or 
demean oneself towards, do, perform, practise (usually with loc. or by itself); 
To act a part, enter upon a course of conduct; To act up to, abide by, (pb) follow; 
To have the sense of, signify, be used in the sense of; To tend or conduce to 
(with. dat.); To rest or depend upon.

Caus. (**वर्तयति-ते**, vartayati-te) To cause to be or exist; To cause to move or turn round, 
cause to revolve; To brandish, flourish, whirl round; To do, practise, exhibit;
To perform, discharge, attend or look to; To spend, pass (as time); To live on, 
subsist; To relate, describe; To perceive, comprehend; To study; To shine; **To speak**; 
To shed (as tears). **वर्तयिष्यामि**, vartayiṣyāmi, is the first person singular future tense, 
"I will speak".  

|<b><font size = "6">सर्वार्थसाधनं शुभम् अजेयं</font></b>|sarv-ārtha-sādhanaṃ śubham ajeyaṃ|能成就一切利益，净妙美好，无能胜，|

*T'eôu/du* represents *dha* of *sādhanaṃ*. Julien (1861:209) gives this character 
for *da, da* besides *tu, du*, etc.

Tun-huang fragment (Pauly 579) has *śrutaṃ*. The Chinese transcription of Bh. 
and Am. is not clear. Ji. and Ko. are clearly *śubhaṃ*.

**अर्थ**, m.n. aim, purpose; cause, motive, reason; advantage, use, utility; thing, object; 

**साधन**, mf(ī or ā)n. leading straight to a goal, guiding well, furthering; effective, 
efficient, productive of (comp.); procuring ; conjuring up (a spirit); denoting,

righteous, virtuous, honest; pure; eminent, distinguished; learned; **शुभम्** is the 
singular accusative case ending. 

**अजय**, mfn. unconquered, unsurpassed, invincible; **अजेय**, mfn. invincible; **अजेयं** is the 
singular accusative case ending with a final nasal. 

|<b><font size = "6">सर्वभूतानां भवमार्गविशुद्धकम्</font></b>|sarva-bhūtānāṃ bhava-mārga-viśuddhakam|清净一切众生三有道。|

Bh. *sarva-satvānām*. Bh. *bhaga*, Am. *vaga*, Ji. *bhavamata*, Ko. *bhavamara*, 
stand for *bhava-mārga*.

Bh. Am. are confused, *ma* belongs to the previous word *mārga*, *vidha* = *vi[śo]dha[kaṃ]*. 
The Siddham transcriber has slurred over with *va dudu*. The character corresponds 
to Sanskrit *tu, du, dha, dhu, duḥ* (Julien 1861:209). Ji. Ko. *viśodhakaṃ*.

**भूत**, bhūtá, mf(ā)n. become, been, gone, past (n. the past); actually happened,

even vegetable), the world (in these senses also m.); a spirit (good or evil), 
the ghost of a deceased person, a demon, imp, goblin (also m.); 

**भूतानां**, bhūtānāṃ, is the genitive (possession) plural case of **भूत** with nasalized ending. 

**भव**, m. (√bhū) coming into existence, birth, production, origin; becoming, 
turning into; being, state of being, existence, life; worldly existence, the

acquisition; a god, deity; Three existences includs: Desire Realm (欲界, Kāmadhātu), 
Form Realm (色界, Rūpadhātu) and Formless Realm (无色界, Arūpadhātu).

**मार्ग**, mārga, m. seeking, search, tracing out, hunting; the track of a wild animal, 
any track, road, path, way to (loc. or comp.) or through (comp.), course (also of 
the wind and the stars); 

**भवमार्ग**, bhava-mārga, can be elegantly translated into Chinese as “三有道”. 

**विशुद्ध**, vi-śuddha, mfn. completely cleansed or purified (also in a ritual sense), 
clean, clear, pure; 

**कम्**, kam, ind. well (opposed to a-kam, “ill”); a particle placed after the word

|<b><font size = "6">ॐ अपलोक लोकातिक्रान्त</font></b>|oṃ apaloka lokātikrānta|唵，眷顾，超越世界者，|

Bh. *avaloka e*, Am. *apaloka e* (a Central Asia form of Avalok[ita]), Ji. *avaloke
