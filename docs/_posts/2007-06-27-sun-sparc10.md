Finally, I rewrite this review of SPARCstation-10 in english and in a more 
serious way. I am pretty sure that there are much more detailed documents at 
SUN help website, I just want to give a gentle introduction here, yet try to 
cover as much I could as possible.

**SPARC** (Scalable Processor ARChitecture) is a **RISC** (Reduced instruction 
Set Computer) microprocessor instruction set architecture originally designed 
in 1985 by `Sun Microsystems`. The **SPARCStation 10** (SS10) contains two MBus 
(MBus is a circuit-switched, cache-coherent shared-memory (ie: multiprocessor) 
bus, using a 36-bit physically addressed 64-bit datapath) slots running at 
either 33/36 MHz or 40 MHz. Usually, the CPUs are mounted on plug-in 
daughter-cards, called **modules**. Each MBus slot can contain single or dual 
SPARC CPU modules, permitting expansion to up to four CPUs and (optionally) some 
second-level cache memory. The one I had here are loaded with dual CPU modules 
on the first MBus slot.

The SS10 has two rows of two SBus slots for peripheral expansion (SCSI cards, 
framebuffers, serial-port cards, etc). This SS10 here has with one single-width 
SBus module holding SCSI and Ethernet interface and another one holding the GX 
8--bit color framebuffers, capable of up to 1280x1024 resolution. The SS10 can 
hold a maximum of 512MB ram in 8 slots. The SS10's enclosure can hold two SCSI 
hard drives (Seagate 1/3-height Barracudas) and a floppy. Other SCSI devices 
can be attached via the external SCSI port. There is no IDE support. There is 
one onboard Ethernet interface, which can be accessed from a built-in 10BASE-T 
jack or via a special 26-pin port that provides both AUI and audio connections; 
There are also two Basic Rate Interface (BRI) ISDN connectors.

There are 3 ways to hook up a monitor to video framebuffers: 

+ get a corresponding Sun monitor; 
+ obtain a 13w3(RGB)-Male/HD15-Male coaxial cable; 
+ use a 100-vt terminal through serial port on board. 

I chose the second option for 16 bucks.

The SS10 had reasonable cooling capacity given the cramped pizzabox case, but 
it was not designed for some of the higher-speed hyperSPARC modules, and so  
heat issues were common when these modules were used, particularly in four CPU  
configurations. Also, the ZX and TurboZX(Leo) SBus grpahics cards generate a 
huge amount of heat. Prolonged overheating may result in damage of killing 
power supply, CPU module(s) SBus card(s) and motherboard.

The SS10 holds system information such as MAC address and serial number in 
**NVRAM** (Non-volatile random access memory), also regarded as Firmware. If the 
battery on this chip dies, then the system will not be able to boot. The last 
available **BootPROM** (Programmable read-only memory) is version 2.25 from Sun, 
or 2.25R from Ross/Bridgepoint. I believe that this one has ROM Rev. 2.12 from 
Sun.

I chose **OpenBSD4.1** as system to install on this machine. An important note 
about OpenBSD/sparc is that it is designed so that a single kernel can run on 
ALL SUPPORTED SPARC machines. Whereas SunOS and Solaris have always had separate 
`kernel architectures`, i.e. sun4, sun4c, and sun4m, the same `GENERIC` OpenBSD 
kernel will run on all the supported models. One thing interesting and mysterious 
during my installation is that multiple processors/modules in **sun4m** systems 
(where ss10 belongs) won't be supported. OpenBSD will not currently boot on 
some machines with multiple processors. You must remove the extra CPUs. 
However, I do get through the installation with 2CPU on MBus!
