I brought this piece of gagdet in 2004 summer when I went to CNS meeting from 
Paris to Baltimore. It has been 3 years since I had it, and I always wanted to 
write something for it. Here it is, since I've just got a place to put it online 
so that everyone of you can read it, thanks to 
[Blojsom](https://github.com/timothystone/blojsom){:target="_blank"}. 

I was amazed by the state-of-the-art Sharp technology and Sharp invovation of 
this unique and compelling PDA solution when I first received it. I will go 
through both hardware and software of this personal mobile tool below.

## Add-on Hardware:

+ The Pocketop keyboard is a compact IR keyboard with Aluminum shell that folds 
in half. It consumes a size AAA battery. An excellent driver for both 5500 and 
5600 was written by Craig Graham.

+ Linksys WCF12 Wireless-B Network CompactFlash Card (Type I): 
size 1.7 x 2.4 x 0.1 inches, weight, 0.6 ounces. It's Compliant with 802.11b, 
DSSS, 2.4 GHz Standard and it supports up to 128-bit WEP encryption security, 
working with SL5600 out of box.

## Add-on Software:

What makes the Zaurus really special is the OS, Linux with 
kernel **2.4.18-rmk7-pxa3-embedix**, ROM 1.32. It means the Z user will have 
numerous GNU softwares offered by third-party. The one I want to mention here 
is zbedic: an electronic dictionary reader for Sharp Zaurus and Linux desktop. 
Over 90 free mono- and bi-lingual dictionaries and Wikipedia (most of them free).

That's pretty much I want to say about this fabulous electronics, Zauurs sl5600. 
It's more than a PDA, it's a tiny Linux computer. Those ambious one can even 
push Z to its limits by creating a cuzsomized ROM image, developping new 
applications, porting existing linux softwares, using network tools to administer 
jobs remotely and wirelessly... I am sure you can find a lot more resources.
