A handy collection of simple daily usage of Git command was maintained for 
one-stop-shop, instead of scattering around in different notes or googling each 
time for the git syntax. 

## Git local tips

### Git Configuration

#### configure ~/.gitconfig

The configuration file includes some colour scheme and command abbreviations. 

~~~ bash
[filter "lfs"]
	clean = git-lfs clean -- %f
	smudge = git-lfs smudge -- %f
	process = git-lfs filter-process
	required = true
[user]
	name = John Doe
[user]
	email = john.doe@domain.com
[core]
        editor = vim
[color]
        ui = auto
        interactive = true

[color "branch"]
        current = yellow reverse
        local = yellow
        remote = green

[color "diff"]
        meta = yellow bold
        frag = magenta bold
        old = red bold
        new = green bold
        whitespace = red reverse

[color "status"]
        added = yellow
        changed = green
        untracked = cyan
[core]
        whitespace=fix,-indent-with-non-tab,trailing-space,cr-at-eol

[alias]
        st = status -u
        ci = commit
        br = branch
        co = checkout
        df = diff
        ld = log -p
        lg = log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --branches --all

### Daily Operation

#### `git-commit` Record changes to the repository, 
	
-m -\-message=
: Use the given <msg> as the commit message.

-a -\-all
: Tell the command to automatically stage all modified files.

~~~ bash
$ git commit -m "message" -a
~~~

-C -\-reuse-message=
: Take an existing commit object, and reuse the log message. 

-\-amend
: Replace the tip of the current branch by creating a new commit.

when two options are combined, the new commit will reuse the `head` log msg.

~~~ bash
$ git commit -C head -a --amend
~~~

#### `git-checkout` Switch branches or restore working tree files  
  
to restore file(s) hasn't been committed. 	

~~~ bash
$ git checkout head file1.txt file2.txt
$ git checkout head *.txt		
$ git checkout head .
~~~
  
#### `git-revert` and `git-reset` to undo changes
  
-n -\-no-commit
: Revert the named commits, but does not make the commits.

e.g., Revert the changes specified by the third last commit in HEAD, but do 
not chreate any commit with the reverted changes. 

~~~ bash
$ git revert --no-commit head~2
~~~

-\-hard 
: Resets the index and working tree. 

Any changes to tracked files in the working tree since <commit> are discarded. 
Any untracked files or directories in the way of writing any tracked files 
are simply deleted.

~~~ bash
$ git reset --hard head
~~~

#### `git-tag` Create, list, delete or verify a tag object

Git supports two types of tags: lightweight and annotated. A lightweight tag 
is very much like a branch that doesn’t change -- it’s just a pointer to a 
specific commit. To create a lightweight tag, don’t supply any of the -a, -s, 
or -m options, just provide a tag name:

~~~ bash
$ git tag v0.1-lightweight
~~~

Annotated tags, however, are stored as full objects in the Git database, and 
are checksummed; contain the tagger name, email, and date; have a tagging 
message; and can be signed and verified with GNU Privacy Guard (GPG). 

-a -\-annotate
: Make an unsigned, annotated tag object

-m -\-message=
: Use the given tag message.

~~~ bash
$ git tag -a v0.1 [<commit| <object>] -m "annotated tag ver 0.1"
~~~

By default, the git push command doesn’t transfer tags to remote servers. 
You will have to explicitly push tags to a shared server after you have 
created them. This process is just like sharing remote branches. 

--tags
: All refs under refs/tags are pushed

~~~ bash
$ git push remote-branch <tagname>
$ git push origin --tags
~~~

-d -\-delete
: Delete existing tags with the given names.

~~~ bash
$ $ git tag -d v0.1-lightweight
~~~

There are two common variations for deleting a tag from a remote server.

~~~ bash
$ git push origin :refs/tags/v0.1-lightweight
$ git push origin --delete <tagname>
~~~

#### `git-grep` and `git-log` Git Tools - Searching
	
Git provides a couple of useful tools for looking through the code and 
commits stored in its database quickly and easily. `git-grep` searches 
through any committed tree, the working directory. `git-log` looking for
when it existed or was introduced.

-n -\-line-number
: Prefix the line number to matching lines.

-e
: The next parameter is the pattern. Multiple patterns are combined by **or**.

-\-and -\-or -\-not
: Specify how multiple patterns are combined using Boolean expressions. 
-\-or is the default operator. -\-and has higher precedence than -\-or. 
-e has to be used for all patterns. 

-c -\-count
: Instead of showing every matched line, show the number of lines that match.

~~~ bash
$ git grep -n -e 'poisson' --and \( -e 'distr' \)
$ git grep -c -e 'poisson' --and \( -e 'distr' \)
~~~	

-G \<regex\>
: Look for differences whose patch text contains added/removed lines that 
match \<regex\>.

-L\<start\>,\<end\>:\<file\> -L:\<funcname\>:\<file\>
: Trace the evolution of the line range given by \<start\>,\<end\>, or by 
the function name regex \<funcname\>, within the \<file\>. 

~~~ bash
$ git log -G "count_multi" --oneline
$ git log -L:count_multi:R_notes.R
~~~	

### Topics

#### git-stash 

Imagine a scenario that you are working on brach_A of a repository, and your boss
comes in and asks you fix a bug in brach_B urgently. The A and B branches have 
diverged from each other for quite some time and have different heads. 

You quickly save your changes to A and try to check out branch B with `git checkout B`. 
Git immediately aborts the operation and throws the error: 
"Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout … 
Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches."

The coventional way would be creating a commit at that point in branch A, commit 
and push your changes to fix the bug in B, then check out A again and `git reset HEAD^` 
to get your changes back.

The method is less flexible because the unfinished saved changes are treated as 
a checkpoint rather than a patch that's still a work in progress. However, `git stash` 
saves the uncommitted changes locally, allowing you to make changes, switch branches, 
and perform other Git operations. You can then reapply the stashed changes when 
you need them. A stash is locally scoped and is not pushed to the remote by git push.

Here are the work flow of using git stash: 

  + Save changes to branch A
  + Run **`git stash`**
  + Check out branch B, Fix the bug, Commit and  push to remote
  + Check out branch A
  + Run **`git stash pop`** to get your stashed changes back.

Git stash stores the changes at **`.git/refs/stash`** and allows you to retrieve 
the changes when you need them. It's handy when you need to switch between 
contexts. It is the fastest way to get your working directory clean while 
keeping changes intact.

  * Create a stash 

    ~~~ bash
	$ # stash untracked files
    $ git stash --include-untracked # or git stash -u 
	$ 
	$ # stash untracked files and ignored files
	$ git stash --all # git stash -a
	$ 
	$ # add a description to the stash
	$ git stash save "description in case of multiple stashes"
	~~~

  * Retrieve a stash 
  
    ~~~ bash
	$ # List the stash entries that you currently have.
    $ git stash list
	$ 
	$ # Show the changes recorded in the stash entry as a diff
	$ git stash show <stash@{1}> 
	$ 
	$ # Remove a single stashed state from the stash list and 
	$ # apply it on top of the current working tree state
	$ git stash pop stash@{1}
	$ 
	$ # apply a single stashed state from the stash list on top of the current 
	$ # working tree state without removing it from stash list
	$ git stash apply stash@{1} 
	~~~
	
  * Clean up the stash
  
    ~~~ bash
	$ # Remove all the stash entries.
    $ git stash clear
	$ 
	$ # Remove a single stash entry from the list of stash entries.
	$ git stash drop stash@{1}
	$ 
	$ # Remove a single stashed state from the stash list and 
	$ # apply it on top of the current working tree state
	$ git stash pop stash@{1}
	$ 
	$ # apply a single stashed state from the stash list on top of the current 
	$ # working tree state without removing it from stash list
	$ git stash apply stash@{1} 
	~~~ 
	
#### git-rebase

The scenario in need of **rebase** is very simple:  you want to integrate the 
changes from branch-B into branch-A. While merging is definitely the easiest and 
most common way to integrate changes in Git, **rebase** the local changes allows 
you clean up your work before pushing. 

There are two way of rebase of branch

  * method **1**: 
    The workflow is that suppose master branch is up-to-date (if not, fetch/merge 
	to update), then you create a new branch, have new commits. 
	
    ~~~ bash
	$ git branch branch_new
	$ git checkout branch_new
	$ git fetch origin master
	$ git merge master 
	$ ...
	$ work work work 
	$ ...
	$ git add --all
	$ git commit -m "commit message"
	$ 
	$ # rebase on master so that the work looks linear in the log
	$ git check out branch_new # unnecessary if already in branch_new
	$ git rebase master
	$ 
	$ # checkout back to master and fast forward merge 
	$ # because only new files are added and there is no conflict
	$ git checkout master
	$ git merge branch_new
	~~~
	
	The new commits of branch_new are applied on top of the master branch with 
	**rebase**. Because branch_new is rebased on master already, there is no 
	conflict. The result looks like development had happened in a straight line.
    Instead of a merge commit that contains all the combined changes, the 
	original commit structure from branch_new was preserved. 
 
 * method **2**: 
   After new commits was made in the new branch. **rebase** was performed from 
   master branch on top of the branch_new. 
   
    ~~~ bash
	$ # after new commits in branch_new, checkout back to master
	$ git checkout master
	$ git rebase branch_new
	First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
    Fast-forwarded master to branch_new
    ~~~	

## Git remote tips

### Generating ssh keys

  * step 1: generating the key pair

    Generate ssh key from git-bash console, -C specify the comments for the 
	public key. After entering the key pair's name and passphrase, the 
	identification has been saved in gh_rsa, i.e., the private key. The public 
	key has been saved in gh_rsa.pub. 
	
    ~~~ bash
	$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "johndoe@PC"
	Generating public/private rsa key pair. 
	Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/johndoe/.ssh/id_rsa): gh_pc_rsa
	Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
	~~~
	
	If the key pair is generated by **PuTTYgen**, the two files will named as: 
	"**gh_pc_rsa.ppk**" and "**gh_pc_rsa.pub**", respectively. These key pairs 
	are in the format of **SSH2**, and will be transformed to OpenSSH compatible 
	format by running the following command through the console: 
	
	-i 
	: This option will read an unencrypted private (or public) key file in 
	SSH2-compatible format and print an OpenSSH compatible private (or public) 
	key to stdout.
	
    ~~~ bash
	$ ssh-keygen -i -f gh_pc_rsa.pub > gh_pc_rsa_open.pub
	~~~	
	
	Alternatively, the **PuTTYgen** generated private key can be modified into 
	OpenSSH format by loading the key in PuTTYgen(File->Load private key) and 
	then exporting it as OpenSSH key (Conversions->Export OpenSSH key). 

  * step2: deploy the key pair at both the client side and server side

    The private key "gh_pc_rsa_open" will be saved under the folder "~/.ssh" at 
	the client side, regardless of the operation system. Then, add a line at 
	the ssh configure file of ~/.ssh/config: 
	
    ~~~ bash
	...
	    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gh_pc_rsa_open 
	...
	~~~	
	
	The public key goes to your GitHub account by the order of **Settings** -> 
	**SSH and GPG keys** -> **New SSH key**, then copy and paste the publick key. 
	
	Adding the new public key to Linux server for a given user can be 
	accomplished by the following command: 

    ~~~ bash
	$ cat gh_pc_rsa_open.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 
	~~~
	
	I haven't tried to use public key authroization from a window machine yet. 
	The two options are **Bitvise** SSH Server and **OpenSSH**. 
	
  * Testing your SSH connection
  
    with or without adding the line of IdentityFile at the ssh configure file
	
	-i identity_file
    : Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for public key 
	authentication is read.
	
	-v
	: Verbose mode.
	
	-T
	: Disable pseudo-terminal allocation.

    ~~~ bash
	$ ssh -vT git@github.com
	$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/gh_pc_rsa_open  -vT git@github.com
	Hi johndoe! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
