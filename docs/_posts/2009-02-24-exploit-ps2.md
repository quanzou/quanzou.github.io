I brought my PS2 at Fnac, Paris on 2004, the bundle include 2 8MB memory cards, 
one controller, and **Primal**. I was really obsessed for a while by Primal, at 
least before I was occupied by my thesis work on 2005---2006. Then, I lived in 
Tianjin for half year right after graduation. I got the machine modified and I 
played **Teiken--5** and **God of War--1** during the time. I left the machine at 
Tianjin until it was carried to Reno early 2009.

I did some research for PS2, it turn out that you could do a lot fun thing for 
your PS2, such as install Hard drive for the chubby model(**3900x**). You could 
dump the game you owned on the hard drive to save the optic reader worn out, or 
install Linux on the hard drive.

European PS2 uses 220v, and has the power plug as double-rod. The first 
difficulty is how to adapt the power. I had two choice, change the power supply 
board for about $19.00, or simply buy a step-up voltage converter($13.00 
for 100--Watt model). I chose the later one, since the voltage converter could 
be used for other electronics, the power board is only for PS2. One thing I 
noticed is to make sure that the power of voltage converter is higher than PS2 
(50 Watts). After a while, the converter broke, and I have to use 110v power 
board:)

To play the game on hard drive, you need prepare a network adapter, of course, 
a hard drive(PS2 will only recognize maximal 120G). You will also have to 
install a software called HD Loader, which enables playing game on hard drive 
at PS2, by cheating the console as if the game is loaded from optic drive. The 
current version is 0.8c, where a fix for the buffer alignment was added into 
the GUI Patcher app and made both **GOW2** and **GTA:LCS** run without crashing. 
This is the unofficial releases, which can be run on a console with a modchip 
installed.

Here, I put down a detailed how-to:

1. softwares you will needed are [uLaunchELF v4.21](https://sksapps.haldrie.com/files/ps2/launchers/launchelf/uLaunchELF_v4.21.zip){:target="_blank"} (previously contained in PS2 52in1 tool boxes), and [Free Mcboot1.5 tools](https://sksapps.haldrie.com/files/ps2/exploit/freevast/FREE_MCBOOT_1.5.rar){:target="_blank"}.

2. unpacked Mcboot1.5, rename `HDL08C.ELF` as `BOOT.ELF`, `LaunchELF421.ELF` as 
`BOOT1.ELF`. open `DVDELF` folder, chose corresponding file for your PS2 version. 
For example, mine is European verison **39004**, so I renamed `DVDPLE` as `DVDELF.BIN`. 
The extension name "ELF" refers to PS2 executable program. Finally, copy the files 
`BOOT.ELF`, `BOOT1.ELF` and `DVDELF.BIN` together with `FREE_MCBOOT.ELF` and 
`FREEMCB.CNF` to usb drive.

3. write uLaunchELF v4.21 into dvd, use it to boot the PS2. Find `LaunchELF4.21`, and 
press **X** to run it.

4. In LaunchELF4.21, go to FileBrowser, go to the root directory of first memory 
card: **`/MC0/`**, make a new directory as "`BOOT`". and copy `BOOT.ELF` and 
`BOOT1.ELF` to the folder. go to **`/MC0/`** make another directory as "`SYS-CONF`".

5. Go to usb drive, run `FREE_MCBOOT.ELF`, and press **X** to install `MCBOOT` 
to PS2. You should be ready to boot from memory card with working HD Loder, 
while holding **L1** (default settings). 

Next thing to worry about is how to copy the game to hard drive. before this, 
I need to explain some thing for clarification purpose. As you start HDL, you 
will have options to choose either **MDMA** or **UDMA**. Most games don't require 
any specific mode enabled, so this is optional. However, it helps if we 
understand what they really are: 

MDMA
: slows hdd access (close to DVD speed)

UDMA
: a faster HDD access. 

You usually don't need to do anything unless specified.

* m0=up (4.2 mb/s)
* m1=triangle (13.3 mb/s)
* m2=left (16.6 mb/s)
* u0=right (16.6 mb/s)
* u1=square (25.0 mb/s)
* u2=circle (33.3 mb/s)
* u3=down (44.4 mb/s)

Within the HDL main menu, there are also 3 compatibility modes:

Mode1
: Slow HDD access

Mode2
: Disable DVD9 Support

Mode3
: Kill HDL after launch

You won't need to set the modes, unless the game requires according to the 
comptibility list, which is too long to list here. When you set the modes 
properly, press select to save them and return to the games list.

The program you need to copy game images is called 
[winhiip](https://www.ps2-home.com/forum/download/file.php?id=341){:target="_blank"}. 
You need to format the hard drive before can copy the images. Please make sure 
the jumper is set to slave when copying images, and to master when plugging 
into the console.
